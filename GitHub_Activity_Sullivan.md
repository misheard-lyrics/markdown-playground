# Getting started with Git Lab
## Instructions
In this lab, we'll be going through some basic tasks you'll need to do as you manage the GitHub repository for your CollectionBuilder site. The questions below are designed to help you learn and remember what you need to do to perform these tasks, as well as where you can go to look for help. 
## Creating your repository and editing files
**What did you click on to create a new repository in the web interface of Github (i.e., on Github.com)?**

On the homepage of GitHub's web interface (https://github.com/), I clicked on the green button towards the middle of the screen labeled "Create a new repository" to create a new repository.

**What is the difference between a private and a public repository?**

A private repository allows the creator to select who can view and commit to the repository, whereas a public repository is viewable to anybody on the internet.

**Once your repository has been made and has at least one file, what button do you need to click on the web interface in order to create a new file in your repository?**

On the webpage for the selected repository (in my case, https://github.com/misheard-lyrics/markdown-playground), I need to click the button labeled "Add file," which opens a dropdown menu, and I then need to click the button labeled "Create a new file."

**Describe the steps you took to clone your repository on Github Desktop**

First, I opened GitHub Deskop and clicked the button labeled "File" in the upper lefthand corner. Then, in the dropdown menu under "File," I clicked the button labeled "Clone repository..." After a new menu opened, I selected the tab labeled "URL." I then copy and pasted the URL of my selected repository (https://github.com/misheard-lyrics/markdown-playground) into the section within the URL tab labeled "URL or username/repository." Lastly, I chose a local path (C:\Users\patpa\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub) and clicked the blue button in the menu labeled "Clone."

**What is the title of GitHub documentation?**

The title of GitHub documentation is GitHub Docs.

**What is the URL for GitHub documentation on creating your first repository?**

The URL for GitHub documentation on creating my first repository is: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository

**Where is your local repository versus the remote repository?**

My local repository is stored on a personal device, which in my case is my laptop, whereas the remote repository is stored outside of a personal device, such as on the internet.

**What happens when you fetch?** 

When I fetch, I download data from the remote repository onto my personal device without making any changes to existing files within my local repository.

**What happens when you pull changes/commits?**

When I pull changes/commits, I download data from the remote repository onto my personal device while integrating this data with my local repository. In other words, pulling changes/commits can modify my local repository by updating or altering existing files so that they are in line with the version from the online repository.

**When working on GitHub Desktop, what order should you generally perform push, pull, and fetch?**

When working on GitHub Desktop, I should generally perform these three actions in the following order: fetch, pull, and push.

**What happens when you push commits from your local repository?**

When I push commits from my local repository, the pushed data is uploaded and added to the remote repository.

**What is the URL for the Github glossary?**

The URL for the GitHub glossary is: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/github-glossary

**Where can you find a list of your commits?**

I can find a list of my commits by first navigating to the webpage for my selected repository (in this case, https://github.com/misheard-lyrics/markdown-playground). Then, I can click on a picture of a clock next to the number of commits and the word "Commits" (it currently reads 4 Commits for me), which opens a list of my commits.

**What is the URL for documentation on reverting a commit?**

The URL for documentation on reverting a commit is: https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/managing-commits/reverting-a-commit-in-github-desktop

**How do you revert a commit?**

To revert a commit, I first open GitHub Desktop and clik the button in the left sidebar labeled "History." Next, I right-click on the commit that I wish to revert, which opens a dropdown menu. I lastly click on the button labeled "Revert Changes in Commit" within the dropdown menu.

## Git-flavored markdown
**What is the name of the page or URL in GitHub documentation where there's information on how to format your Markdown for GitHub?**

The URL in GitHub documentation with information on how to format Markdown for GitHub is: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax

**What precedes a second-level heading in Github markdown?**

Two # symbols (##) precede a second-level heading in GitHub markdown.

**How do you indicate text that has been struckthrough?**

I indicate text that has been struckthrough by placing two ~ symbols on each side of the text. For example, I can write the word "text" as ~~text~~.

**How do you create a hyperlink in your markdown?**

I can create a hyperlink in my markdown by writing text in brackets next to the link in parentheses. [For example, this text is a hyperlink to the GitHub homepage.](https://github.com/)

**How do you link to a section in the same or another markdown file?**

I can link to a section in the same or another markdown file by hovering over a section heading and clicking on the image of a chain. Clicking on this image will allow me to select the section and link it elsewhere. The code might look, for example, like: [text](#identifier for section)

**What are the three possible symbols for indicating an unordered list?**

The three possible symbols for indicating an unordered list are: -, *, and +.

**Format the following text into a footnote:**
Alex Wingate went to William and Mary.[^1]

[^1]: William and Mary is a university in Williamsburg, VA founded in 1693.  

Bonus: make "William and Mary" a hyperlink to W&M's website.
